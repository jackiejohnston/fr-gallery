title: Death of Rubén Salazar
description: Romero memorializes Rubén Salazar, a <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite> journalist
  and key chronicler of the Chicano civil rights movement. After covering the Chicano
  Moratorium of 1970, an anti-Vietnam War demonstration, Salazar stopped at the Silver
  Dollar Café in East LA. Reports of an armed disturbance sent deputies to the scene.
  A tear-gas projectile shot into the bar killed Salazar instantly. Romero combined
  references to this tragic day with a vision of the future when Salazar is the subject
  of a film announced on a theater marquee. The work's large scale and subject link
  it with a tradition of grand painting that commemorates events that shaped history.
