description: 'From <a href=''https://www.laweekly.com/arts/chicano-legend-frank-romeros-dreamland-retrospective-at-the-museum-of-latin-american-art-is-an-essential-chronicle-of-la-history-good-a-8014267''
  target=''_blank''>LA Weekly</a>: <blockquote>In Frank Romero''s 1996 painting <cite>The
  Arrest of the Paleteros</cite>, towering palm trees reach into an evening sky streaked
  with pink and reflect off the placid surface of Echo Park Lake, a sight that cuts
  to the core of Los Angeles'' awe-inspiring beauty. But in the foreground, there''s
  chaos. Framed in a cop car''s headlights, four ice cream vendors reach into the
  air — echoing the palm trees in the background — as police officers train their
  weapons on them and two small children holding paletas in their tiny fists. Off
  to the left, a balloon vendor is pursued on foot by a cop with his billy club drawn.
  The balloon man is wearing an almost cartoonish outfit and his mouth is agape, which
  seems to further emphasize the absurdity of LAPD''s excessively zealous crackdown
  on unlicensed vendors in the early ''90s.</blockquote>'
