          <blockquote class="lead">"He's one of the great Chicano painters, and I like watching his levity. He has a great sense of humor and he can really manipulate paint. It's like a musician who knows how to play&hellip;he's not counting anymore, he knows exactly what he's doing, and his art unfolds just like that. It's amazing to watch."</blockquote>

        <p>Throughout his career as an artist, Frank Romero has been a dedicated member of the Los Angeles arts community. As a member of the 1970s Chicano art collective, Los Four, Romero and fellow artists Carlos Almaraz, Beto de la Rocha and Gilbert Lujan, helped to define and promote the new awareness of La Raza through murals, publications and exhibitions. Los Four's historic 1974 exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art was the country's first show of Chicano art at a major art institution.TEST</p>
